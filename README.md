# Time Perception Experiment with PsychoPy

Welcome to the Time Perception Experiment with PsychoPy! This experiment is designed to assess time perception using a modified Stroop test implemented with PsychoPy. Participants' reaction responses are recorded in relation to a predetermined time, allowing for the investigation of individual time perception. The stimuli randomization is achieved through a Latin rectangle design.

## Experiment Overview

- **Stimulus**: Modified Stroop test using Pygame.
- **Data Collection**: Reaction responses of participants in relation to a predetermined time.
- **Randomization**: Latin rectangle design for stimulus randomization.

## Procedure

1. **Installation**: Make sure you have PsychoPy installed on your machine. You can install it using [this guide](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the experiment repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/time-perception-experiment.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Directory**: Open a terminal and go to the directory where you cloned the repository.

    ```bash
    cd time-perception-experiment
    ```

4. **Run the Experiment**: Execute the experiment script, for example:

    ```bash
    python stroop_time_perception_experiment.py
    ```

5. **Collect Data**: The experiment will record participants' reaction responses. Collected data will be stored for further analysis.

## Experiment Customization

Feel free to customize the experiment based on your specific research requirements. You can modify the experiment script, change stimulus parameters, or adjust the time intervals to suit your needs.

## Randomization

Stimulus randomization is achieved through a Latin rectangle design, providing a balanced presentation of stimuli across participants.
